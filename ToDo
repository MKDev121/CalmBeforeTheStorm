Finally implemented animation system properly, was trying to make the system genralised.
Due to creation of object inside the loop, the current frame was always setting to the default frame,the only way out is 
to make sure the object creation occurs only one time.This will be the major thing in spawning units.
For Now I will take rest for 6 hours(in between breakfast), and will start working on spawning around 11:00 AM

(11:00 AM)
Applied the animation system for all the main objects in the game.
Also completed the work on spawning system,its rough but I will polish it later.
Right now will take a break, will get back to work at evening.
Up Next is to draft the basic gameplay.

(9:00 PM)
Started working on the basic gameplay mechanic, right now I am just drafting the mechanic on paper.
Will implement the idea by tonight and also will polish the spawning system.

Implemented the basic gameplay mechanic but the command selection is not that responsive so I have to rework on it 
to make it more responsive.
Will work on it after classes

(4:00 PM)
So I reworked on the command selection, turns out that using pygames.event more than once in the whole application makes things
irresponsive, so I have to take care of that.
Now I will just implement all the animation of the other units and will take a break, after that I will plan for the next tasks to be done.

(6:23 PM)
Back to work! so I have decided the next list of task which is to polish previous work, work on Inventory and Shopping system
Right now I will do some polishing

(7:26 PM)
So did some polishing like setting the size of command window depending on the length of the command text with most letters,
corrected the spawn position of units and flipped the tank.
Will take break and go for dinner
