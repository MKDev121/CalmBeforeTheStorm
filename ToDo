(2:36 AM) 
Finally implemented animation system properly, was trying to make the system genralised.
Due to creation of object inside the loop, the current frame was always setting to the default frame,the only way out is 
to make sure the object creation occurs only one time.This will be the major thing in spawning units.
For Now I will take rest for 6 hours(in between breakfast), and will start working on spawning around 11:00 AM

(11:00 AM)
Applied the animation system for all the main objects in the game.
Also completed the work on spawning system,its rough but I will polish it later.
Right now will take a break, will get back to work at evening.
Up Next is to draft the basic gameplay.

(9:00 PM)
Started working on the basic gameplay mechanic, right now I am just drafting the mechanic on paper.
Will implement the idea by tonight and also will polish the spawning system.

(1:05 AM)
Implemented the basic gameplay mechanic but the command selection is not that responsive so I have to rework on it 
to make it more responsive.
Will work on it after classes

(4:00 PM)
So I reworked on the command selection, turns out that using pygames.event more than once in the whole application makes things
irresponsive, so I have to take care of that.
Now I will just implement all the animation of the other units and will take a break, after that I will plan for the next tasks to be done.

(6:23 PM)
Back to work! so I have decided the next list of task which is to polish previous work, work on Inventory and Shopping system
Right now I will do some polishing

(7:26 PM)
So did some polishing like setting the size of command window depending on the length of the command text with most letters,
corrected the spawn position of units and flipped the tank.
Will take break and go for dinner

(10:26 PM)
So rightnow I am working on the UI art,will go to sleep at 11:30 PM, will do the implementation of UI for inventory tomorrow.

{25/10/2024}
(11:22 AM)
Will try to implement the UI for inventory in the game.

(12:55 PM)
Okay so I have completed the visual stuff of Inventory UI, now only the mechanic of selection of item is left. Will do it after
MATLAB class. Will go for sleep.

(8:57 PM)
So I am done with the Inventory UI implementation but I am facing issue with mouse down input as all stuff in the gameplay is controlled by mouse, things are contradicting with each other. So I have to rework on the mouse input tomorrow, right now I am gonna play RE7.

{26/10/2024}
(11:43 AM)
In the train, but thinking to work on the mouse down input problem,will try best to fix it today.

(1:00 PM)
Well so brain not braining will take a nap, watch movie and in evening will try to fix things up.

(3:47 PM)
Back to again, will fix this shit for sure.
*After 10 mins*
Well so the problem was that when player is trying to select character it also set mouse down true for invenotory slots,I have added a bool for this but TBH I may rework on this mouse input thing in future.
And also I am dropping the shopping system for now because it will again cause the mouse input issue which I am tired off.
I will work on something else , maybe sound system.

(6:41 PM)
So I have decided to work on the UI of characters, like there action turn timer, health bar, getting selected.
*Few minutes later*
On Second thought I will do this work tomorrow , kinda bored.

{27/10/2024}
(9:30 AM )
Alright Back again, will do work today before reaching home

(10:08 AM )
So I am kinda a done with this bar stuff, some polishing is required which I will do later.

(10:24 PM)
At Home!!! Will do some polishing for the bar stuff.

{28/10/2024}

(10:00 AM)
So completed the work on the bar, also added the animation bar and a function which updates the values at each frame.
Still some adjustment will be needed but ya the work is done.

{15/12/2024}

(10:22 PM)
So I am finally back to work, My first priority is to rework the mouse input system.

(11:30 PM)
Started working on the input system, will try to finish this tomorrow.

{16/12/2024}
(10:45 AM)
Alright, resuming the work on the input system, so far its going good.

(12:45 PM)
Okay so I am almost done witht the rework.The idea was to use only one varaible set of mouse state and input rather than
each object having its own set.Had to create a seperate file for that as there was some "circular import" type error.
Will do rest of the work in evening , hopefully I will complete this by tonight

(7:12 PM)
So I am done with the reimplementation of mouse input, the input now works properly, atleast for now.I will compare both the old and new input system,upload this update in discord.Will think on what to do next.

{19/12/2024}
(7:47 PM)
So decided to work on sound systems,through the help of chatgpt I got to know about how sound works in pygame.
Basically there are channels which play's one sound object a time, by default pygame has 8 channels.But we can set the number of channels before game loads.
Though we can't change the number of channels in runtime.
That's why only some actions on the screen will get sound.
Action like player selecting character, giving command, spawning, destruction etc.. actions which happens by players decesions or not much repetative.
Also there will be dedicated channel for background music.
For now I will give sound effects to player's command and selection,but will expand it later.
Background music by - Music by Vlad Krotov from Pixabay

(8:36 PM)
So I am down with the sound system, basically there one class audiosource which we use to play different sounds in the game. Will add more sounds after adding enemies.Also added music,maybe I will change it later but for now it is fine.

{27/12/2024}
(10:43 AM) 
So I am at home, currently chilling, but I will try do something.Today I will think on Enemies and gameplay loop.
Want to keep it simple so I can finish this project before club audition begins.

(5:14 PM)
So I have planned out how many enemies will be their and what are their characteristics & properties.
I will use the same classes from units.py script with some modification so it can incoporate enemy behaviour.
